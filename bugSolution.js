```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 via-teal-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
This improved code adds a `via` color to create a more distinct gradient.  Experiment with different color combinations and `via` colors to achieve the desired visual effect.
