```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS's gradient feature.  However, if the `from` and `to` colors are too similar, the gradient might not be visible or might appear as a solid color, leading to a subtle visual bug that isn't immediately apparent.
